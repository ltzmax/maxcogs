## onconnect

# NOTE
This cog sends shard events and and can be extremely spammy sometimes, depending on how your connection to discord is, if your host is slow or having a bad time with discord, it will choose to send reconnections each times it finds out the shards is having a bad time. This is not a bad thing, its just a good thing, you have control that your shard actually reconnected. so dont worry about it.

Just anyother note:
- When you set event channel to any channel you want it to send to, you have agreed that you want the spam to happen.

## READ BEFORE YOU SET CHANNEL
- ⚠ **Before you set event channel make sure your bot has `manage_webhooks` in the channel you select to use as event.** ⚠

me as owner of this cog is not responsible for your log being spammed with errors of missing permission.
